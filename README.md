## Why

Developing [Free
Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) is about
liberating users and giving them total control over how the programs
they run should work. It's only fair that developers of such software
enjoy the same levels of liberty. ForgeFed is an attempt to enable
federation for major software forges(GitLab, GitHub, Gitea, Source Hut,
etc.) entirely in API-space. Prior to this, [there was an attempt to do
the same](https://forgefed.peers.community/) but it was a very involved
protocol and required participation from the forge developers. We
believe our API-space implementation will allow for more organic growth
as it will not require any involvement from the forge developers.
