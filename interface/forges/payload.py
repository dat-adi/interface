        When messages(issues, comments and PRs) are federated over, it's
        possible that the Interface might not render them properly or it may
        not be possible to present the received information as the forge may
        not support that message type(reactions, etc).

        In these cases, including tracable information within all federated message
        in the form of a header will enable the user overcome these deficiences.

        Additionally, there can be multiple interfaces running on the same
        forge, which makes it difficult to trace which interface the message
        came from. So including source information in the header can help with
        administrative tasks.
